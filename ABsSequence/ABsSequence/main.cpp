/** Problem Statement
 *	Let's consider an infinite sequence S of non-negative integers defined as follows:
 *
 *	S0 = first;
 *	S1 = second;
 *	Si = |Si-2 - Si-1| for all i >= 2.
 *
 *	You will be given s first and second, representing the 0-th and the 1-st elements of the sequence S, and a indices, each element of which represents a non-negative integer without extra leading zeros. Return a containing as many elements as indices, where the i-th element is equal to the indices[i]-th element of the sequence S (index is 0-based). No element of the return should contain extra leading zeros.
 *
 *	Definition
 *	Class: AbsSequence
 *	Method: getElements
 *	Parameters: string, string, vector <string>
 *	Returns: vector <string>
 *	Method signature: vector <string> getElements(string first, string second, vector <string> indices)
 *	(be sure your method is public)
 *	Limits
 *	Time limit (s): 840.000
 *	Memory limit (MB): 64
 *	Constraints
 *	- first will represent an integer between 0 and 10^18, inclusive, with no extra leading zeros.
 *	- second will represent an integer between 0 and 10^18, inclusive, with no extra leading zeros.
 *	- indices will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
 *	- Each element of indices will represent an integer between 0 and 10^18, inclusive, with no extra leading zeros.
 *	Examples
 *	0)
 *	"21"
 *	"12"
 *	{"0", "1", "2", "3", "4"}
 *	Returns: {"21", "12", "9", "3", "6" }
 *	Here S0=21 and S1=12. The next three sequence elements are S2 = |21 - 12| = 9, S3 = |12 - 9| = 3 and S4 = |9 - 3| = 6.
 *	1)
 *	"0"
 *	"0"
 *	{"1000000000000000000"}
 *	Returns: {"0" }
 *	Here we get the sequence consisting of only zeros.
 *	2)
 *	"823"
 *	"470"
 *	{"3","1","31","0","8","29","57","75","8","77"}
 *	Returns: {"117", "470", "2", "823", "115", "87", "49", "25", "115", "23" }
 *	3)
 *	"710370"
 *	"177300"
 *	{"5","95","164721","418","3387","710","0","1197","19507","5848"}
 *	Returns: {"178470", "108270", "90", "0", "90", "90", "710370", "90", "0", "0" }
